An old script I made around February 2016 to test out the Steam web API and Trade.tf API. Displays the higher price of a given item in a given quality according to Trade.tf
s item price spreadsheet.

Uses the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master) module for Python and requires both a [Steam Web API](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/) key and [Trade.tf API](http://www.trade.tf/user/api/key) key. These should be placed within the `keys.json` file included.
